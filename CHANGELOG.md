# Changelog

pptx-agent has not been released to PyPI. The public repository starts from a single
snapshot commit; the development history before it is summarised here.
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) has the detail.

## 0.0.1 -- 2026-10-08 (initial public release)

Developed 2026-09-12 and 2026-10-01 to 2026-10-08:

- **Document core:** lossless OOXML editing with stable shape ids, now on
  [`ooxml-edit`](https://github.com/uvrt/ooxml-edit); undo, redo and batches.
- **Editing API:** text with formatting, fills and outlines in theme colours, slides,
  pictures, groups, connectors routed as PowerPoint routes them, tables, charts with
  their cache and embedded workbook in step (`slide.add_chart`), SmartArt nodes,
  threaded comments, new decks from nothing or from a template, Markdown outlines.
- **Feedback:** rendering through pptx2svg with matching ids, a full-state SVG that
  applies back, fit and collision checks, text measured before building, layout helpers
  and data-to-position scales, design facts.
- **Agent tools** (`pptx_agent.tools`) on `ooxml_edit.tools`, documented in
  `SUPPORTED.md` and `GUIDANCE.md`, with golden transcripts of the trial tasks.
